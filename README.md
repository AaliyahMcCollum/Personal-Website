# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my Personal Portfolio Website — a project designed to showcase my work, skills, education, and accomplishments as a Software Engineer and Computer Science student.

This site is built from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean UI, responsive layouts, and smooth interactions. It also features interactive elements, a typewriter effect, project sections, and custom UI components like liquid glass cards and responsive navigation.
